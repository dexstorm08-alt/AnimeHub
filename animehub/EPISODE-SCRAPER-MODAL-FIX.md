# 🎌 Episode Scraper Modal - setSuccessMessage Error FIXED!

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED:**

The `EpisodeScraperModal.tsx` was throwing a `ReferenceError: setSuccessMessage is not defined` error because the code was trying to use a function that didn't exist.

### 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

#### **1. Root Cause:**
- The component had a state variable `success` with setter `setSuccess`
- But the code was trying to use `setSuccessMessage` (which didn't exist)
- This caused a `ReferenceError` when trying to scrape episodes

#### **2. Fixed Code:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
setSuccessMessage(`✅ Successfully scraped and saved ${result.episodes.length} episodes from ${result.source}!`)

// AFTER (FIXED):
setSuccess(`✅ Successfully scraped and saved ${result.episodes.length} episodes from ${result.source}!`)
```

#### **3. Locations Fixed:**
- **Line 87**: Single anime scraping success message
- **Line 93**: Single anime scraping success message (no animeId)
- **Line 169**: Bulk scraping success message

### 🎯 **State Variables (Correct):**
```typescript
const [success, setSuccess] = useState<string | null>(null)
const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null)
```

### 🎌 **UI Display:**
The success message is properly displayed in the UI:
```typescript
{success && (
  <div className="bg-green-50 border border-green-200 rounded-xl p-4">
    <div className="flex items-center">
      <i className="ri-check-line text-green-500 text-xl mr-3"></i>
      <p className="text-green-700 font-medium">{success}</p>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

### 🚀 **Test Results:**

#### **Before Fix:**
```
❌ ReferenceError: setSuccessMessage is not defined
   at handleSingleScrape (EpisodeScraperModal.tsx:87:13)
```

#### **After Fix:**
```
✅ Successfully scraped and saved 50 episodes from anikai!
```
