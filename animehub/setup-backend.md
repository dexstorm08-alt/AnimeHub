## 🎉 You're Ready!

You now have a complete backend foundation that can power an anime streaming platform like AnimeKai or HiAnime. The services I've created handle:

- User authentication and profiles
- Anime and episode management
- Video streaming and storage
- User preferences (favorites, watchlist)
- Watch progress tracking
- Premium content access
- Analytics and statistics

Start with Supabase, and you can always migrate to a more complex backend later as your platform grows!
